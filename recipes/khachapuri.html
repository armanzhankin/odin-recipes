        <h3>Descriptons</h3>
        <p>Ajarski khachapuri is a boat-shaped Georgian bread with a cheese-stuffed crust and an egg baked into the center. It's only a matter of time before this fun bread is delivered to every home for pizza night and ordered from every brunch menu the morning after. This versatile bread takes a little finesse, but the payoff is well worth it; after all, what more could you want other than cheesy, soft, chewy bread dipped in runny yolk and molten cheese?</p>
        
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        
        <h4>Pastry:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>4 cups all-purpose flour, divided</li>
            <li>4 ½ teaspoons active dry yeast</li>
            <li>3 ½ teaspoons white sugar</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
            <li>1 cup milk</li>
            <li>½ cup margarine</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Filling:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pound shredded Muenster cheese, or more to taste</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>1 egg, separated</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine 2 cups flour, yeast, sugar, and salt in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment</li>
            <li>Combine milk and margarine in a 1-quart saucepan; heat over low heat until milk is very warm and margarine is mostly melted, about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Beat milk mixture into the flour mixture on low speed until just combined. Increase speed to medium and beat until smooth, about 2 minutes. Add remaining 2 cups flour; beat until a soft dough forms. Switch to the dough hook and knead until smooth and elastic, about 10 minutes</li>
            <li>Transfer dough to a greased bowl. Turn over to coat. Cover and let rise until doubled, about 1 hour.</li>
            <li>Gently punch down dough to deflate. Let rise until doubled again, about 45 minutes.</li>
            <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a 9-inch round baking pan.</li>
            <li>Gently punch down dough and roll into a circular shape. Transfer to the baking pan.</li>
            <li>Mix Muenster cheese, egg, and egg yolk together in a bowl. Spread over dough in the baking pan. Gather up dough in 1 1/2-inch pleats. Squeeze pleats together gently and twist to make a topknot.</li>
            <li>Let dough rest, 10 to 15 minutes. Brush with egg white.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 1 hour.</li>
        </ol>
